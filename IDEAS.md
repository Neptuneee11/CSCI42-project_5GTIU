## Lubak on Track
  A webapp (for now) on rating road conditions of philippine roads. Supposedly aimed for cyclists. \
  This could be a strava add-on \ 
### Features:
* Map data showing all road obstructions at what time at what place
* Rating each stretch of road depending on how physically obstructed it is
* Forums with comment sections and moderators making sure of the validity of each post.
* Each forum is accessed via clicking on the map of the road you want to see.
* Posts in the forums can have a picture, location information, and time of photography.
* Posts can be categorized into pointing out one obstruction, or a review of a certain stretch of road.

## Bike Rentals 
  Make renting bikes accessible in Ateneo. \
  The idea came into fruition due to the excessive number of cars in Ateneo which leads to a "traffic-lock" during peak hours. The bike-rental idea hopes to lessen the traffic inside campus and make travelling faster for the users.\
### Features:
* Locating bikes which are 'ready-to-be-used'
* Locating stations to be able to leave the bike once rented.
* Option for users to allow their personal bikes to be rented out by users of the app.
* 
## Profs to Pick 2 
 A web app that streamlines the Profs to Pick experience from simply being a forum in the Facebook page to a standalone platform dedicated to improving and easing experience for Ateneo college students.\

### Features:
* Dedicated Profiles for professors with basic information and a dashboard of common characteristics often used by the students to describe the professor
* Includes a star rating and review system which can be sorted from most recent, to most relevant based on the most liked comment
* Includes a separate page for recommendations on passing the professor's class
* User must use obf or ateneo email in order to gain access to the web app, increasing its reliability and authenticity
* Search query for professor based on star rating, and subject's taught by professor
* Advance search query based on the semester to see that semester's reviews, and star rating on the professor
* Feature page of current highly rated professors
* Admin discretion to remove foul reviews that are inauthentic based on user feedback 
* Page for user feedback on possible improvements and implementations on the app
